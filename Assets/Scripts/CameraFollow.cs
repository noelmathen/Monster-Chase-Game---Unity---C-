        if(player) //this condition is checked at the player enemy collision part(player script enemy_tag part). After destroying the gameObject(player) after colliding with enemy, this part of code still tries to access the player object. this will raise an error. So here we will give a condition to check, if player exists, then we will change position of camera, if it doesnt exist, we will not access it.
            tempPos.x = player.position.x;  //then we change the tempPos's x value to the players x value.

        if(tempPos.x < minX)
            tempPos.x = minX;   //checks if the position of the camera went beyond its allowed value in the left side. if then, we will stop moving the camera
        if(tempPos.x  > maxX)
            tempPos.x = maxX;   //same thing in the right side

        transform.position = tempPos;   //finally we make the tempPos value back to the original camera position variable.
